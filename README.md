# PE File Parser

A comprehensive cross-platform PE (Portable Executable) file parser and analyzer written in C++. This tool provides detailed analysis of Windows PE files including headers, sections, imports, exports, and resources with **advanced malware detection capabilities** featuring import obfuscation detection, security assessment, and evidence-based threat classification.
