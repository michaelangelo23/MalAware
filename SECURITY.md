# Keeping MalAware Secure

Hey there! Security is a top priority for us, and we really appreciate your help in keeping MalAware safe. Here's what you need to know:

## Currently Supported Versions

We're actively maintaining and providing security updates for:
- Version 1.0.x âœ…

## Found a Security Issue?

First off, thank you for caring about security! If you think you've found a vulnerability, we'd love to hear about it - but let's keep it private to protect everyone.

### How to Report

Send us an email at lolpix3l@proton.me

Please don't post about security issues in public GitHub issues - this gives us time to address the problem before it becomes widely known.

We'll get back to you within 48 hours. If you don't hear from us, please feel free to send a follow-up email - sometimes messages get lost in spam filters!

### What to Include

To help us understand and fix the issue quickly, it would be super helpful if you could tell us:

1. What kind of security issue you found (like a buffer overflow, injection vulnerability, etc.)
2. Where you found it (which files or code areas)
3. How to make it happen (steps to reproduce)
4. What could go wrong if someone exploited it
5. If you have ideas for fixing it, we'd love to hear those too!

The more details you can share, the faster we can get it fixed!

### Language

We work primarily in English, so English communications are preferred. However, we'll do our best to understand and respond to any security report, regardless of language.

### Our Approach

We believe in responsible disclosure - meaning we work together privately to fix security issues before they become public knowledge. This protects everyone using MalAware.

Thank you for helping make MalAware more secure!
